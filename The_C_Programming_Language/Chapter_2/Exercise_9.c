/* In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost 1-bit in x . 
Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster version of bitcount . */



/* bitcount:  count 1 bits in x */
int bitcount(unsigned x)
{
    int b;

/* Answer:

If x is odd, then (x-1) has the same bit representation as x except
that the rightmost 1-bit is now a 0. In this case, (x & (x-1)) == (x-1).

If x is even, then the representation of (x-1) has the rightmost zeros
of x becoming ones and the rightmost one becoming a zero. Anding the two
 clears the rightmost 1-bit in x and all the rightmost 1-bits from (x-1).

Here's the new version of bitcount: */

    for (b = 0; x != 0; x &= (x-1))
